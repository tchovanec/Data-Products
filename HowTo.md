The purpose of this application is to help you to choose the best car for your trip, utilizing the mtcars dataset from [R].
The application takes multiple paramters to help you make the best car selection. 

First, you will need to input the distance of your trip in miles. Then the current price of gas and the max amount you would like to spend on gas. 
Lastly, you can choose from additional specfications of a vehicle such as, Horsepower(HP), Transmission(Auto or Manual), Cylinder(4,6,8) and Displacement.

The information in the table dynamically changes based on your filter selections. The table will only show cars that have miles per gallon (mpg) that can go below your inputed value.
The table can be sorted by clicking on the arrows at the top of the table.  

There is also a serach box that allows you to search for any vehicle in the dataset. For example, you can type "Corolla" and you will see Toyota Corolla's in the result.
